	<p>
		My name is Luke Gusukuma, a graduate student at Virginia Tech, currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science under <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~kafura/">Advisor Dennis Kafura</a>

	<p>
		My research interests are in Computer Science Education, HCI (immersive virtual environments), motion planning (Crowd Simulation/Animation), and GP-GPU Programming (software engineering issues).

		Aside from Computer Science, I am also a flute performance music major graduate from Virginia Tech as well.
